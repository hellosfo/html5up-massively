								<p>Dear Editor

									 "Few can doubt that we need a vaccine for covid-19 as soon as possible..."[1]
									
									But why? Why do we need a vaccine for covid-19? Is it feasible to seek a vaccine for every ailment?
									
									Consider the death statistics attributed to covid-19 in England and Wales over the past eight months - according to the ONS, a total of 52,026[2] in a population of 59.5 million people.[3]
									
									Subtracting the deaths of people aged 85 years and over, i.e. 21,984, leaves 30,040 deaths.
									
									Further subtract the deaths of people aged 75 to 84 years, i.e 16,820, leaves 13,220 deaths.
									
									And further subtracting the deaths of people aged 65 to 74 years, i.e. 7,683, leaves 5,537 deaths in people aged under 65 years, over the past eight months.
									
									There were six deaths in children 14 years and under; 562 deaths in the age group 15 to 44 years; and 4971 deaths in the age group 45 to 64 years. (Possible comorbidities unknown.)
									
									Looking at those figures in the context of 59.5 million people, and seeing that most deaths are in people aged over 75 years, likely with comorbidities, and with negligible deaths in children and young people, how can mass vaccination be justified?
									
									This is especially serious to consider when so much remains unknown about immunity, and about the experimental vaccine products which are currently being rushed through trials.
									
									It's more especially serious to consider given that it's been suggested a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2/covid19 may not work well in older people, and that children will be vaccinated to supposedly protect the elderly.[4]
									
									How can it be justifiable to risk the apparently natural defences of most of the population, particularly children and young people, with what is likely to be annual coronavirus vaccination, i.e. coronavirus vaccination throughout life? This is replacing natural immunity with purported vaccine immunity, with unknown long-term consequences. Is it ethical to risk the natural defences of the young? Should not more consideration be given to other preventative measures and treatments?
									
									It really is astonishing that ethical consideration hasn't been given to this matter, instead rushing off to develop vaccine products for the entire global population at Bill Gates’ behest[5], without properly thinking this through.
									
									People need to think about this...now...

Realistically, if we’re going to return to normal, we need to develop a safe, effective vaccine. We need to make billions of doses, we need to get them out to every part of the world, and we need all of this to happen as quickly as possible."
